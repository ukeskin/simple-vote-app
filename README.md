## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-vote-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd simple-vote-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you've configured).

## Usage

## Dockerization

This project can be run using Docker. Follow these steps to build and run the Docker container:

### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t simple-vote-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data simple-vote-app
   ```

Your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose to run the application:

1. Make sure you have Docker Compose installed.
2. Run the following command in the project root:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This will build the image if it doesn't exist and start the container in detached mode.

### SQLite Database Persistence

The SQLite database file is stored in the `/app/data` directory inside the container. This directory is mapped to the `./data` directory in your project root on the host machine. This ensures that your database data persists even when the container is stopped or removed.

### Environment Variables

If your application uses environment variables, create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following line to the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `app` service:

```yaml
env_file:
  - .env
```

Then run the container with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
